  </div>

<p>
This programming assignment is the complement of the
<a href="project1uml.html">Design Document 1</a>
assignment.  The general task was already explained; this assignment
description provides additional details and tips for the programming
aspects of the redesign.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>Task Overview</h3>
</div>
<i>At this point you should have looked at the UML for the project.</i>
<p>
You must identify the behavior associated with each class (i.e.,
the behavior exhibited by instances of the class) and move that behavior
from the standalone static methods in <code>Functions.java</code> to
(static or non-static, as appropriate) methods defined within the class.
For this assignment, you will not add new functionality (aside from some
accessor/mutator methods, only as needed). This is to be done in two forms:
an UML design document (design document 1 assignment) and a
refactoring of the provided source code that executes as before.
</p>

<p>
You are encouraged to develop the UML design document first, however,
you are also welcome to simultaneously work on the code
refactoring.  If you do start refactoring the code, you are encouraged to <i>implement
the refactoring incrementally so that your refactored program executes
properly at each step.</i>
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Objectives</h2>
</div>

<ul>
<li>To be able to read and understand java code in terms of methods and class instances
<li>To be able to identify and convert static methods into instance methods to better associate computation with data
<li>To be able to translate your code design from UML into refactored Java code
<li>Specifically, for this assignment, in the actual java code, move almost all static methods in the file <code>Functions.java</code> to the appropriate class
<li>To be able to make design changes to a large code base and have the code still work
</ul>





<div class="header">
<h2>Building and Executing</h2>
</div>

<p>
   After completion of the first few lab assignment(s) for this course, you
should be comfortable with the basics of building and executing Java
programs on both the command-line and in IntelliJ.
</p>

<p>
   The provided source code relies on the <a href="https://processing.org/">
processing.org</a> API for the graphical interface.  To use this API external
to the Processing environment, you will need a jar file *please use the provided file 
<b>processing-experimental.jar</b> file for both compilation and execution. *Note we are using a modified Processing jar that supports more recent versions of java, so please be sure to use the jar included in the zip file for this assignment.*
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>Command-line Execution</h3>
</div>

<p>
   Without introducing a build tool, the most direct approach to building
and executing the program is as follows.
</p>

<p>
To compile all source files, execute the following in the directory
holding the files.
</p>

<blockquote>
javac -cp ${CLASSPATH}:processing-experimental.jar *.java
</blockquote>

<p>
To execute the program, execute the following in the directory
holding the files.  This also assumes that the <code>world.sav</code>
file, the <code>imagelist</code>, and the <code>images</code> directory
are also in the same directory.
</p>

<blockquote>
java -cp ${CLASSPATH}:processing-experimental.jar VirtualWorld
</blockquote>

<h4 class="header">CLASSPATH</h4>

<p>
When compiling and running Java programs, the Java compiler/run-time
will search various locations for classes that your program uses.  This
allows, for instance, multiple Java programs to share libraries.  The
<code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable is how one specifies the
locations to search for such classes.  You can simplify the above
commands by setting the <code>CLASSPATH</code> in your shell
configuration files (typically in <code>.mybashrc</code> on the CSL
machines).
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>IntelliJ</h3>
</div>

<p>
   The following steps will guide you through the creation of a new
   project to build and execute the given program.  (We are going
   through the steps as part of learning the tool for your future
   use.)
</p>

<ul>
   <li>
      Create a new Java project.  You will not need to select any special
      libraries/features or to use any template.
   </li>
   <li>
      Add the <code>.java</code> source files to the project.  This is
      most directly done via a graphical interface by selecting and
      dragging (or copying, if you prefer) the files to the <code>src</code>
      directory (folder) in the IntelliJ project view.
   </li>
   <li>
      Edit the Configurations (can be selected from the Run menu).  Click
      <code>+</code> to add a new configuration. Select <code>Application</code>,
      enter <code>Basic</code> (for instance) as the name, and enter
      <code>VirtualWorld</code> as the main class.
      (You might add additional configurations with <code>-fast</code>,
      <code>-faster</code>, or <code>-fastest</code> as the respective program
      argument later.)
   </li>
   <li>
      Open the Project Structure (under File) and select the Dependencies tab.
      Click the <code>+</code> to add a new JAR.  In the file selection
      dialog, find and select the
      <b>processing-experimental.jar</b> that
      you should have downloaded previously in the project zip file.
   </li>
</ul>

<p>
You should now be able to build and execute the program.  Executing the
program, however, will not load the proper resources for the graphical
interface.
</p>

<p>
To run the program properly, copy the <code>world.sav</code> file, the
<code>imagelist</code>, and the <code>images</code> directory to the 
project folder in the project view.
</p>

<h4 class="header">Whoa!</h4>
<p>
That was a lot of steps.  If you got stuck and something is not working,
just ask for assistance in office hours or lab.  Or take the opportunity
to ask another student in the CSL (my experience is that the majority of
students in the department are kind and want to help others succeed).
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Source Code Refactoring</h2>
</div>

<p>
   You must refactor the methods from the <code>Functions</code> class
to move them into the appropriate classes as previously discussed.  As
each method is moved, you will need to make modifications to the code
that uses the method.
</p>

<p>
   Your refactoring should mirror the work done for your design document
(UML diagram) augmented with feedback from your instructor.
</p>

<p>
   Your refactoring must not add or remove any functionality.  Your
refactoring may add accessor/mutator methods, but only as needed.
The resulting program must work as before.
</p>

<p>
   It is not sufficient to simply move the static methods from
<code>Functions</code> to the other classes and then continue to invoke
them as public static methods.  For instance, if you determine that a
method works primarily on data within an <code>Entity</code> object, then
the method must be made non-static and the explicit <code>Entity</code>
argument will be replaced by the implicit <code>this</code>.  This
modification will necessitate appropriate changes to the invocation of
the method.
</p>

<p>
   As an example, moving the following (fake) method into <code>Entity</code>
will change it as shown.
</p>

<blockquote>
   <pre>
      class Functions
      {
         public static void turnAround(Entity entity, int numRotations)
         {
            ... entity.id ...
         }

         ...
            // invocation of turnAround
            turnAround(entity, 20);

      }
   </pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
   becomes
</p>

<blockquote>
   <pre>
      class Entity
      {
         public void turnAround(int numRotations)
         {
            ... this.id ...
         }

         ...
            // invocation of turnAround
            entity.turnAround(20);

      }
   </pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Tips on Refactoring Methods</h3>
</div>

<p>
   You can use the compiler (on the command-line or in the IDE) to help
you with your refactoring.  In particular, as you make changes, the compiler
will flag now invalid uses of moved methods.  This serves two purposes.  The
first, and arguably most important, is gaining an understanding of the error
messages that the compiler reports and the reasons for such error messages.
Nobody enjoys seeing error messages, but quickly interpreting and addressing
such errors will improve your workflow.
</p>

<p>
   The second purpose for using the compiler as an aid is that it can quickly
identify all parts of a code base affected by a change.  This is incredibly
beneficial when working with unfamiliar code.  (Many IDEs also provide
similar support even without explicitly compiling.)
</p>

<p>
   Consider the following more specific tips.
</p>

<ul>
   <li>
      Examine the data attributes in each class.  Draw a graph of dependencies
      between the classes (in the project) based on the data stored in each
      (e.g., <code>WorldModel</code> relies on <code>Entity</code>).  Start
      your refactoring by moving methods into those classes that depend on
      the fewest other classes.
   </li>
   <li>
      In the class you are currently examining, change the access modifier
      for each data attribute to <code>private</code>.  Compile the program
      to determine which methods attempt to access these private attributes.
   </li>
   <li>
      If you are using IntelliJ, explore using the
      <code>Refactor &gt; Move</code> feature.  Though this feature will not
      make all of the necessary modifications, it will help with the task.
      Be ware that overuse of this feature may interfere with the learning
      objectives; but using this feature after manually moving a few methods
      will save you time.
   </li>
   <li>
      After moving a method (and removing <code>static</code>), remove the
      target object from the parameter list (and change all uses within the
      method to <code>this</code>, implicitly or explicitly).  Compile the
      program to determine where the method was invoked.
   </li>
</ul>


Recall from the design document:
<h4 class="header">Access Modifiers</h4>
<p>
   With the exception of some constant (<code>static final</code>) values,
   all data attributes should be <code>private</code> and, when possible,
   <code>final</code>. (<code>Point</code> is the exception to this since
   each value acts as a constant value akin to an integer.)
</p>

<p>
   Methods should also be <code>private</code> unless <code>public</code>
   access is necessary (i.e., it is used outside of the defining class).
   For this project, every method should be either <code>private</code>
   or <code>public</code> (it is often better to avoid the default of
   package-protected).
</p>
