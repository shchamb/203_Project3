<p>
Just as in the real world, characters (people and animals)
have both state (i.e., data, e.g., where they are in the world and their mood),
and are capable of actions (e.g., walking, eating, etc.). We want our
computational objects to encapsulate both data and functions (called methods
when they are associated with an object).
</p>

<p>
This first course project is split into two parts: a design document
and an implementation refactoring.  In doing this project, you will gain
experience with methods to specify an object's behavior and with basic
UML class diagrams.
</p>

<p>
For this project you will be provided the code for a virtual world program
and a UML diagram of the classes used to structure this program.  The program,
as given, is written in a non-object-oriented style like that seen in
CPE 101.  In particular, the vast majority of the functionality is defined
as <code>static</code> methods in the <code>Functions</code> class (with a
few methods defined in <code>EventComparator</code>, <code>Point</code>,
and <code>VirtualWorld</code>).  You should take some time to skim the
provided code to get a basic sense of how it is organized.  <small>(You might
question the quality of this design (which is great!), especially if you have
some experience with object-oriented design; you should, however, note that this
is a perfectly valid approach (though some parts are intentionally structured
for later improvements) that might actually serve you well in a language that
does not directly support object-oriented programming, such as C in CPE 357.)

<h3>Task Overview</h3>
</div>

<i>You must become familiar with reading the code base, but for this first
part of this part of the assignment you will only be modifying the UML, so the below
refers to making changes in the UML diagram.</i>
<p>
You must identify the behavior associated with each class (i.e.,
the behavior exhibited by instances of the class) and move that behavior
from the standalone static methods in <code>Functions.java</code> to
(static or non-static, as appropriate) methods defined within the class.
For this assignment, you will not add new functionality (aside from some
accessor/mutator methods, only as needed). 
</p>

<p>
You are encouraged to develop the UML design document first, however,
you are also welcome to simultaneously work on the code
refactoring.  If you do start refactoring the code, you are encouraged to <i>implement
the refactoring incrementally so that your refactored program executes
properly at each step.</i>
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Objectives</h2>
</div>

<ul>
<li>To be able to read and understand java code in terms of methods and class instances
<li>To be able to identify where a static method should be moved to better associate computation with data
<li>To be able to modify an exisiting UML diagram (moving methods from one class to another, and adding any necessary accessor methods)
<li>Specifically, for this assignment, in the UML, move almost all static methods in the file <code>Functions.java</code> to the appropriate class
</ul>



<div class="header">
<h2>UML of the source code as-is</h2>
</div>

Start by getting a copy of the UML diagram of the project as-is.  This is available on the PolyLearn.

<p>
The provided UML diagram was created using the freely available
<a href="https://www.yworks.com/products/yed">yEd Graph Editor</a>.
You may use this on the department workstations or install it on your
own machine.  This editor was selected for its simplicity in the number
of features available for UML editing (our intentionally limited use of
UML is sufficiently supported without a potentially overwhelming number
of additional features).
</p>

<p>
On the department workstations, you can execute yEd as follows:
</p>
      <blockquote>
java -jar /home/akeen/public/yed/yed.jar Methods.graphml
      </blockquote>

<p>
Selecting a class diagram, right-clicking, and then selecting the
Properties option will open a dialog window to allow editing the
class diagram.  Selecting the UML tab will then allow editing the
lists of attributes and methods.  <small>(This dialog window can
be resized; I realized this too late.  For those that like living
dangerously, the <code>.graphml</code> file is a plain text format
that can be edited directly.)</small>
</p>
<b>Please take a moment to load the given digram into yEd and take a look at the general structure of the project.  We will be using this code base for the rest of the quarter so please take the time to make friends with it.</b>


<div class="header">
<h2>The source code</h2>
</div>

Your first task is to modify the UML such that the <code>static methods</code> in <code>Functions.java</code> are moved to be appropriate instance methods for the various classes.
As you are working on this, you may want to refer to the actual code.  And for the
next part of this assignment you will in fact refactor the code based on your UML design.
<p>

The provided source code is available on PolyLearn.
</p>


<p>
Details on building and executing the program are given in the description
of <a href="project1code.html">Programming Assignment 1</a>.
</p>


<div class="header">
<h2>Design Document - what you *need* to do</h2>
</div>

<p>
In general, this assignment will take some careful thought and design, so
take the time to read the provided code and to plan your actions before
making modifications (some tips for identifying methods are given later
in this document). Read, think, design, and <i>then</i> code.
</p>

<p>
Note that good design is somewhat subjective.  Even so, for the vast majority
of the methods, there is a single "correct" class into which the method should
be moved.  For a small number of methods, one could reasonably argue in favor
of a few different classes.  For example, there are multiple classes with which
one could reasonably associate the <code>adjacent</code> method.  Do your best
to make reasonable decisions based on the design discussion in lecture and
document these decisions in your design document.
</p>

<h4 class="header">Access Modifiers</h4>
<p>
   With the exception of some constant (<code>static final</code>) values,
   all data attributes should be <code>private</code> and, when possible,
   <code>final</code>. (<code>Point</code> is the exception to this since
   each value acts as a constant value akin to an integer.)
</p>

<p>
   Methods should also be <code>private</code> unless <code>public</code>
   access is necessary (i.e., it is used outside of the defining class).
   For this project, every method should be either <code>private</code>
   or <code>public</code> (it is often better to avoid the default of
   package-protected).
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>Deliverables</h3>
</div>

<p>
   Your "design document" will consist of two parts: an updated UML diagram
and a text document.  First, copy the provided UML diagram to
<code>Methods.graphml</code>.  Then update this copy to reflect all
method/data movements as well as any newly created accessor/mutator methods.
</p>

<p>Second, in a plain text file (named <code>DESIGN.txt</code>) list each of
the methods that was left in the <code>Functions</code> class and give a
brief justification for why this method was not moved.  You should also
list each method that you feel could be reasonably placed in multiple
classes and note 1) the class you selected and 2) the reason for that
selection.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>Identifying Methods</h3>
</div>

<p>
The provided source code uses objects to hold data; these objects have
no methods (no behavior).  Your task for this assignment is to identify
the behavior associated with objects (instances) of a class and move
this behavior from standalone functions to methods defined within the
class.
</p>

<p>
Reasonable steps for this assignment include (additional, programming-specific,
tips are given in
<a href="project2.html">Programming Assignment 1</a>):
</p>

<ul>
   <li>
      <p>Run the program.  You can use <code>-fast</code>, <code>-faster</code>,
      <code>-fastest</code> on the command-line to increase the rate at which
      actions are executed.  You can use the arrow keys to shift the view of
      the virtual world.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>Read (skim) the source code.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>View the provided UML diagram to see the name of each class and the
         data stored within instances of each class.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>Identify methods that interact with the data stored within an object
         (and identify the object's class).
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>Match behavior to classes.  </p>
      <p>When looking for good matches of functions with classes, consider
         the following hints:
      </p>
         <ul>
            <li><p>If the attribute of an object is accessed directly
                  via a dot (e.g., <i>entity.name</i>), then either
                  the function in which this access appears should be
                  defined in the object's class, or the access should be
                  done via an accessor method.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>If a method determines its behavior based on the "kind"
                  (e.g., the the various values of <code>ActionKind</code> or
                  <code>EntityKind</code>)
                  of object it is manipulating, then this method should likely
                  be moved into that object's corresponding class (do not
                  introduce separate classes at this time).
               </p>
            </li>
         </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         There are some methods that may remain as static methods, but
         that are reasonably moved into another class (these are often
         considered "utility" methods derived from decomposing a problem
         into simpler methods).
      </p>
      <p>
         There are some methods that will reasonably remain as static
         methods in the <code>Functions</code> class because there are
         not yet appropriate classes for them.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>Run the program to verify that it behaves as expected.
      </p>
   </li>
</ul>
